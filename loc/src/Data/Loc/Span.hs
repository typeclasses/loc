A 'Span' consists of a start location ('start') and an end location ('end').
The end location must be greater than the start location; in other words, empty
or backwards spans are not permitted.

Construct and combine spans using 'fromTo', 'fromToMay', '+', and '-'.

Attempt to construct a 'Span' from two 'Loc's. The lesser loc will be the
start, and the greater loc will be the end. The two locs must not be equal,
or else this throws 'EmptySpan'.

/The safe version of this function is 'fromToMay'./

{- |

Attempt to construct a 'Span' from two 'Loc's. The lesser loc will be the
start, and the greater loc will be the end. If the two locs are equal,
the result is 'Nothing', because a span cannot be empty.

/This is the safe version of 'fromTo', which throws an exception instead./

All of the lines that a span touches.

Spans that are directly abutting do not count as overlapping.

>>> overlapping (read "1:5-1:8") (read "1:8-1:12")
False

But these spans overlap by a single character:

>>> overlapping (read "1:5-1:9") (read "1:8-1:12")
True

Spans are overlapping if one is contained entirely within another.

>>> overlapping (read "1:5-1:15") (read "1:6-1:10")
True

Spans are overlapping if they are identical.

>>> overlapping (read "1:5-1:15") (read "1:5-1:15")
True

-}
overlapping :: Span -> Span -> Bool
overlapping a b =
  not (end a <= start b || end b <= start a)

{- |

Determines whether the two spans touch any of the same lines.

>>> linesOverlapping (read "1:1-1:2") (read "1:1-1:2")
True

>>> linesOverlapping (read "1:1-1:2") (read "1:1-2:1")
True

>>> linesOverlapping (read "1:1-1:2") (read "2:1-2:2")
False

-}
linesOverlapping :: Span -> Span -> Bool
linesOverlapping a b =
  not $
    (Loc.line . end) a < (Loc.line . start) b ||
    (Loc.line . end) b < (Loc.line . start) a

{- |

Two spans are considered to "touch" if they are overlapping or abutting;
in other words, if there is no space between them.

>>> touching (read "1:1-1:2") (read "1:2-1:3")
True

>>> touching (read "1:1-1:2") (read "1:1-1:3")
True

>>> touching (read "1:1-1:2") (read "1:3-1:4")
False

-}
touching :: Span -> Span -> Bool
touching a b =
  not (end a < start b || end b < start a)

{- |

>>> join (read "1:1-1:2") (read "1:2-1:3")
1:1-1:3

>>> join (read "1:1-1:2") (read "1:1-1:3")
1:1-1:3

-}
join :: Span -> Span -> Span
join a b =
  Span (min (start a) (start b))
       (max (end   a) (end   b))

{- |

Combine two 'Span's, merging them if they abut or overlap.

>>> read "1:1-1:2" + read "1:2-1:3"
One 1:1-1:3

>>> read "1:1-1:2" + read "1:1-3:1"
One 1:1-3:1

>>> read "1:1-1:2" + read "1:1-11:1"
One 1:1-11:1

If the spans are not overlapping or abutting, they are returned unmodified
in the same order in which they were given as parameters.

>>> read "1:1-1:2" + read "2:1-2:5"
Two 1:1-1:2 2:1-2:5

>>> read "2:1-2:5" + read "1:1-1:2"
Two 2:1-2:5 1:1-1:2

-}
(+) :: Span -> Span -> OneToTwo Span
a + b
  | touching a b = OneToTwo.One (join a b)
  | otherwise    = OneToTwo.Two a b

{- |

The difference between two 'Spans's. @a '-' b@ contains what is covered by
@a@ and not covered by @b@.

>>> read "2:5-4:1" - read "2:9-3:5"
Two 2:5-2:9 3:5-4:1

>>> read "2:5-4:1" - read "2:5-3:5"
One 3:5-4:1

>>> read "2:5-4:1" - read "2:2-3:5"
One 3:5-4:1

Subtracting a thing from itself yields nothing.

>>> let x = read "2:5-4:1" in x - x
Zero

>>> read "2:5-4:1" - read "2:2-4:4"
Zero

>>> read "1:1-8:1" - read "1:2-8:1"
One 1:1-1:2
